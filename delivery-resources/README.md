This folder contains the presenter and attendee presentation decks and the guidance needed to run the **ILL392** lab session at the Microsoft AI Tour or re-deliver it at user groups, user enablement sessions, community events and other similar engagements.

## Who this guide is for

- **Lead presenters** delivering the 75-minute lab session on stage or in a hands-on lab room.

- **Community speakers/MVPs** re-delivering the lab session at user groups, user enablement sessions, community events, and other similar engagements.
- **Customers/attendees** participating in the lab session and following along with the instructions.

If you are an attendee working through the lab, start at the root [README](/README.md) and [instructions](/instructions/part-0-setup-azure-resources.md).

### Timing

| Time | Description|
|---|---|
| 00:00 - 02:00 | Introduction and overview of the lab session |
| 02:00 - 15:00 | The Caldova overview and key concepts |
| 15:00 - 70:00 | Lab Steps & Completion |
| 70:00 - 75:00 | Wrap up & Q&A |

## Demo reproducibility

This hands-on lab uses the runnable notebooks in [`src/`](/src/) rather than a separate live demo. Before delivery, complete the environment steps in [`setup/SETUP.md`](/setup/SETUP.md), confirm the required Azure resources and environment values are available, and run the notebooks in order:

1. `1-data-setup.ipynb`
2. `2-app-development.ipynb`
3. `3-diagnostics.ipynb` when diagnostics or troubleshooting are needed

Use the attendee guidance in [`instructions/`](/instructions/) to verify the database connection and the transition from setup to the notebook exercises.
