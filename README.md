## 🔥 ILL392: Build agentic AI Postgres apps on Azure HorizonDB

### Session description

How can you ship agentic apps fast if your data layer keeps fragmenting? Learn how to build an agentic app with Azure HorizonDB (Postgres) as your relational store, full-text search engine, vector database, graph database, and long-term memory store for the agent.

### 🚀 Getting started

#### In a guided session

If you're following along during a live session:

1. Open the lab environment and sign in with the provided credentials.
2. Follow the setup guidance in [`instructions/README.md`](instructions/README.md)
3. Open and follow the exercises in the [`instructions/`](instructions/) folder.

#### On your own

If you're learning at your own pace at home:

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your environment by following the steps in [the self deployment guide](setup/SETUP.md)
3. Follow the session guidance in [`instructions/`](instructions/README.md), then work through the 2 notebooks in the [`src/`](/src/) folder sequentially.

### 🎯 Learning outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Create a Postgres database serving relational, vector, full-text, and graph queries.
- Load a dataset and enable extensions inside HorizonDB.
- Assemble a Microsoft Agent Framework agent employing BM25 keyword search, vector similarity (DiskANN), citation-graph traversal (Apache AGE), in-database entity extraction (`azure_ai`), and an external weather API.

### 💻 Technologies used

- Azure HorizonDB with rich AI extension surface (`vector`, `pg_textsearch`, `age`, `pg_diskann`, `azure_ai`)
- Microsoft Agent Framework
- Apache AGE
- Azure OpenAI
- Mem0
- Gradio
- Python and Jupyter notebooks (driven by `psycopg`, `openai`, `agent-framework`, `mem0`, `gradio`)
- External weather API
